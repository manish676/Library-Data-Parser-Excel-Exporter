  <h1>ðŸ”° Convert in Excel</h1>
ðŸ”„ Project Overview

The Convert in Excel project is designed to convert data from a custom file format (.tt1) into an Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx). The script extracts and organizes data such as serial numbers, accession numbers, titles, authors, and more, making it easier to analyze and store in a structured Excel format. It utilizes Python libraries like openpyxl and pandas for efficient data handling and export.

<h2>ðŸ“Š Features</h2>

<h2>Data Extraction:</h2>
Reads and processes data from .tt1 file format.
Skips invalid or incomplete lines to ensure clean data extraction.
Data Organization:
Extracts fields like Serial Number, Accession Number, Title, Author, Place, Publisher, Year, and Edition.
Excel Export:
Converts the structured data into an Excel file (.xlsx) for easy analysis and storage.
Uses the openpyxl engine for efficient Excel file handling.
ðŸ”§ Installation and Setup

<h2>Clone the repository from GitHub:</h2>

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Row-DataToExcel.git
cd Convert-in-Excel
Install the required Python libraries:

bash
Copy code

Add the dataset file (e.g., libsys1.tt1) to the project directory.

<h2>ðŸ”€ Usage</h2>

<h2>Step 1: Load Data
Run the script to process and extract data from the .tt1 file:

bash
Copy code
python Convert_in_Excel.py
Step 2: Analyze Data
After running the script, the data will be saved in an hhh.xlsx file. You can open this file in any spreadsheet software (e.g., Microsoft Excel) for further analysis.

<h2>Step 3: Customize</h2>
You can modify the file path or adjust the data parsing logic if the format of your input file differs. Ensure that the .tt1 file follows the expected format with at least 8 fields per line.

<h2>ðŸ“Š Example Outputs</h2>
